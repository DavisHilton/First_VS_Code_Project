      <p>The handsome, noble German Shepherd is a member of the herding group, and he is currently the second most
        popular dog breed in the U.S only behind the labrador retriever. German Shepherds are big dogs that need
        plenty
        of space, so one of these pups won’t suit you if you live in a small apartment without a garden. As he was
        bred
        to be a working dog, the German Shepherd needs lots of exercise and games to keep his body and brain occupied.
        So, be warned, these pups are not couch potatoes!

        The German Shepherd is an excellent choice of dog for you if you enjoy spending time in the Great Outdoors.
        These dogs also do well in families with kids, as they’re a loyal and loving breed. Your German Shepherd will
        be
        the happiest living indoors as a family member.

        In this article, we take a detailed look at the German Shepherd. When you’ve finished reading, you’ll know
        whether one of these pups would make the perfect pet for you. So, let’s learn more about the highly
        intelligent,
        trainable German Shepherd!

      <p>The Bullmastiff is a mighty pup who is a true gentle giant. But, try to mess with his family, and he’ll step
        in
        to protect them ferociously. This big softie is a well-balanced pooch for most family homes. There are also
        some
        important factors to consider that some dog owners aren’t prepared for.

        Bullmastiffs need lots of room, attention. They also fit best with an experienced dog family that understands
        how to handle large, guardian dog breeds. There are some traits within their DNA that are difficult to train
        out
        of, and first-time dog owners can find that to be a challenge with dominant breeds. Unfortunately, that can
        lead
        to Bullmastiffs ending up in shelters, which is a horrible experience for both the dog and their former
        owners.

        By understanding what you can expect when adopting a Bullmastiff, you can properly prepare for “big dog”
        ownership. When trained properly, there are few breeds that can rival their loyalty, dedication, and
        unconditional love for their family. Let’s dive in and see if this gentle giant is the perfect canine
        companion
        for your family!
